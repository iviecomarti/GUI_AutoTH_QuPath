# GUI_AutoTH_QuPath

This script creates a GUI in which the user can choose the setings to apply different Auto-threshold methods for segmentation.
The script list the channels for Fluorescence, H&E and H-DAB images. Tooltips appear for each of the fields.

This discussion about Auto-Threshold started here: https://forum.image.sc/t/applying-automatic-threshold-method-in-qupath/88287

@yau-lim did the original core funcionality of the Auto-Threshold in this script: https://github.com/yau-lim/QuPath-Auto-Threshold


@iviecomarti did the GUI arround and modified a bit the functions for the Auto-TH.


@zindy removed deprecated libraries and made posible that the GUI appears as a tab.

The inspiration to do the GUI was the "Create thresholder" pane into QuPath. The idea was to make it familiar to the user. 

Due some libs, the script just works for QuPath versions 0.5 or above.

We hope you enjoy the GUI!
